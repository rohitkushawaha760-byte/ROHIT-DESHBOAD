SUMMARY:--

The sales dashboard analysis from January 2017 to November 2018 highlights a strong overall
business performance. The company achieved a total sales value of 459.9K, with a profit of
231.5K and costs amounting to 228.5K, resulting in a profit margin of approximately 50%.

The Central region contributed the majority of sales (57%), followed by the North (22%) and
South (21%) regions. Among customers, Aaron Davey emerged as the top contributor to overall
sales.

Product-wise, Bookcases, Chairs, and Phones were the leading sub-categories, demonstrating
strong demand in office and technology segments. The order trend showed consistent growth
across 2017–2018, peaking during mid-2018.

While the performance is commendable, further expansion in underperforming regions and
low-selling product lines can drive additional revenue. Overall, the business shows steady growth,
high profitability, and strong customer engagement across key segments.
